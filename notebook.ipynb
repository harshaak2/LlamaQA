Healthcare data  that provide s \\ncrucial insights into human physiological conditions  are time -sensitive. \\nElectroencephalogram (EEG)  signal  is one of the important healthcare data that gives \\nvast medical  information about  human brain conditions  [1]. Moreover, the EEG \\nsensors generate continuous signal s and a large  volume of sensitive data. Analyzing \\nEEG healthcare data is vital for clinical decisions and epidemiological research . \\nTherefore, the ado ption of fog computing is vital  for efficient EEG data computation, \\nfaster decision -making, and minimizing latency. Fog computing is an extension of \\ncloud computing that provides  lightweight processing , real -time data analysis , and a \\nlimited storage capaci ty [2], [3]. The fog devices are  also capable of handling EEG \\ndata generated from multi -channel EEG devices  [4].   \\nMoreover, the fog computing  architecture is useful for minimizing  the delay  and \\nenergy  and cost  using various optimization techniques.

Many techniques are develope d by \\nthe researchers emphasizing the optimal selection methods for various applications, \\nbut there is a lack of developments in EEG healthcare systems. In this work, the \\nauthors have focused on the optimal fog head selection technique for EEG based \\nhealthc are systems using the Pareto Optimization [10].  \\n1.1   Motivation  and Contribution  \\nThe existing EEG healthcare systems are mostly cloud -dependent  [11]. The cloud \\nprovides major  services such as big data management, permanent storage , and heavy  \\nprocessing; b ut consumes high bandwidth and high latency which is unacceptable in \\nreal-time healthcare analysis  [12], [13] .

To address the \\nabove challenges, fog c omputing is integrated with multiple EEG healthcare systems. \\nThe integration of fog computing supports real -time data analysis with minimum \\nlatency and faster response time  [14], [15] . Further, it supports scalability and \\nheterogeneity which helps in proce ssing huge volumes of EEG data in a distributed \\nmanner  [16]. The contributions in this paper are listed below:  \\ni) A two -layer architecture is proposed, where multiple EEG devices are merged in \\none platform to perform distributed computation and data analyt ics connecting with a \\ngroup of heterogeneous fog devices . \\nii) An optimal  Fog Head  (FH) and an Alternate Fog Head (AFH) are selected using \\ntwo-dimensional  Pareto  optimization undertaking multiple scenarios.  \\niii) Further delay analysis is performed in the fo g layer with a change in the number of \\nEEG devices and the number of fog devices.  \\n   The further sections are organized as follows: Section 2 describes the proposed \\nmethodology. Section 3 illustrates the simulation result. Finally, section 4 concludes \\nthe paper.  \\n2   Proposed Methodology  \\nIn this paper, the authors have proposed a multi -layer architecture where multiple \\nEEG devices collaborate with multiple fog devices through a fog head. In the real \\nscenario, a single fog device is not sufficient for process ing EEG data from multiple \\nEEG devices due to energy, storage , and computational constraints.

Paper [6] uses FireFly \\noptimization for cost -reduction -based resource allocation and load balancing in  cloud \\nfog architecture.  Further, multiple heterogeneous fog devices participate in parallel \\nand distributed decision -making processes. Therefore, the optimal selection of fog \\nheads and fog resources is necessary  [7], [8], [9] . Many techniques are develope d by \\nthe researchers emphasizing the optimal selection methods for various applications, \\nbut there is a lack of developments in EEG healthcare systems. In this work, the \\nauthors have focused on the optimal fog head selection technique for EEG based \\nhealthc are systems using the Pareto Optimization [10].  \\n1.1   Motivation  and Contribution  \\nThe existing EEG healthcare systems are mostly cloud -dependent  [11]. The cloud \\nprovides major  services such as big data management, permanent storage , and heavy  \\nprocessing; b ut consumes high bandwidth and high latency which is unacceptable in \\nreal-time healthcare analysis  [12], [13] . Moreover, EEG devices are single -user \\nassistive devices  and, therefore need dedicated computing resources. To address the \\nabove challenges, fog c omputing is integrated with multiple EEG healthcare systems. \\nThe integration of fog computing supports real -time data analysis with minimum \\nlatency and faster response time  [14], [15] . Further, it supports scalability and \\nheterogeneity which helps in proce ssing huge volumes of EEG data in a distributed \\nmanner  [16]. The contributions in this paper are listed below:  \\ni) A two -layer architecture is proposed, where multiple EEG devices are merged in \\none platform to perform distributed computation and data analyt ics connecting with a \\ngroup of heterogeneous fog devices . \\nii) An optimal  Fog Head  (FH) and an Alternate Fog Head (AFH) are selected using \\ntwo-dimensional  Pareto  optimization undertaking multiple scenarios.  \\niii) Further delay analysis is performed in the fo g layer with a change in the number of \\nEEG devices and the number of fog devices.  \\n   The further sections are organized as follows: Section 2 describes the proposed \\nmethodology. Section 3 illustrates the simulation result. Finally, section 4 concludes \\nthe paper.  \\n2   Proposed Methodology  \\nIn this paper, the authors have proposed a multi -layer architecture where multiple \\nEEG devices collaborate with multiple fog devices through a fog head. In the real \\nscenario, a single fog device is not sufficient for process ing EEG data from multiple \\nEEG devices due to energy, storage , and computational constraints. Therefore, \\nmultiple fog devices having different configurations are considered for this work. \\nAlso, in this work, an optimal fog device among all the fog devices is selected which \\nis discussed further.

       "'Fog computing is a distributed computing paradigm that involves processing data closer to the source of the data, rather than sending it to a centralized cloud or data center for processing. In contrast to traditional cloud computing, where data is sent to a remote server for processing, fog computing brings computing resources closer to the edge of the network, typically within a few kilometers of the data source. This can help reduce latency and improve real-time processing capabilities, making it particularly useful for applications that require fast processing times, such as IoT devices, autonomous vehicles, and smart cities.\\n\\nFog computing typically involves a distributed architecture with multiple nodes located at different points in the network, each node performing specific tasks and communicating with other nodes to achieve a common goal. This allows for more efficient use of resources and can help ensure that data is processed closer to where it is generated, reducing latency and improving overall system performance.\\n\\nSome key characteristics of fog computing include:\\n\\n1. Edge computing: Fog computing involves processing data closer to the edge of the network, typically at the network gateway or within a local area network (LAN).\\n2. Distributed architecture: Fog computing typically involves multiple nodes located at different points in the network, each node performing specific tasks and communicating with other nodes to achieve a common goal.\\n3.

Distributed decision-making: Fog computing supports distributed decision-making processes better than cloud computing as it allows for multiple fog devices to participate in parallel processing and decision-making. This can lead to faster and more accurate analysis and diagnosis in healthcare applications.\n",
      "9. Better integration with existing systems: Fog computing integrates well with existing healthcare systems, such as hospitals' electronic medical record (EMR) systems, laboratory information systems, radiology systems, etc., due to its close proximity to the source data and faster processing times.\n",
      "10. Better adaptability: Fog computing is more adaptable than cloud computing as it can be easily scaled up or down depending on changing healthcare needs, whereas cloud computing often requires significant infrastructure changes to accommodate changes in workload or demand."
